                <p>Life is changing for me. I'm going into Stony Brook University as a computer science major.</p>
                <p>Academically, my first goal is to be able to do more than just the bare minimum in all my classes at Stonybrook. I also want to retain the necessary knowledge for my major (not just learn everything, get a 100%, then forget everything after graduation).</p>
                <p>Socially, my goal is to join at least 2 or 3 clubs (full time) and be able to actually converse with the people there.</p>
                <p>Physically, I hope to establish some kind of consistent exercise schedule.</p>
                <p>I also want to get into an internship (or part-time job) for the summer next year. Preferably one involving coding.</p>
                <p>For long term goals, like career goals, I'm not sure. There are many things I can do, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Machine learning and AI</li>
                    <li>Programming a robot</li>
                    <li>Data analysis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And other things. But for now, my only long term goal is to pass the interview process and secure a job that pays well and does not have a toxic work environment.</p>
