                <p>I have always had a passion for Python ever since I learned it when I was 11. I enjoy making my own Python programs and games.</p>
                <p>In my first year of high school, I joined a club where I learned HTML and CSS. I enjoyed it and made my own page on Replit (before they removed HTML webpages). After some time, I lost interest in HTML and CSS, but that returned when we began learning HTML here at KKCF. I have in mind a personal project of making a live webpage for a game.</p>
